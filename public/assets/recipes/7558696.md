## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 boneless pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick
- 2 teaspoons taco seasoning spice blend
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup coarsely chopped green bell pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (10-ounce) cans diced tomatoes and green chilies (such as Ro-telÂ®), with juice
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 1/4 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups frozen corn kernels, thawed
- 2 cups sliced zucchini
- 1 cup uncooked rice
- flat-leaf parsley or cilantro (optional)
- lime slices (optional)

## Directions

### Step 1
Heat olive oil over medium heat in a 12-inch skillet. Season both sides of pork chops with taco seasoning, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt.

### Step 2
Place chops in the hot skillet and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a plate, and keep warm.

### Step 3
In the same skillet, cook and stir onion and bell pepper, until the vegetables just begin to pick up a little color, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

### Step 4
Pour in diced tomatoes and green chilies, with their juices, and stir, being sure to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet.

### Step 5
Add chili powder and black pepper to the chicken broth, and stir in.

### Step 6
Add thawed corn kernels, sliced zucchini, and uncooked rice. Stir until vegetables are evenly distributed, and make sure all the rice is submerged in the cooking liquid. Bring to a boil.

### Step 7
Nestle pork chops into the skillet contents, and add any accumulated juices from the chops. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 20 minutes.

### Step 8
Remove cover, and continue to simmer until rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of pork chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

### Step 9
Garnish with flat-leaf parsley or cilantro and lime slices. Serve warm.
