## Ingredients
- 1 (5 1/2 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet
- 7 small potatoes, peeled and diced
- 4 medium carrots, peeled and diced
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped

## Directions

### Step 1
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).

### Step 2
Place corned beef brisket in the center of a roasting pan. Arrange potatoes and carrots around the sides, then scatter onion and garlic over top. Sprinkle seasoning packet over beef, then pour in water until potatoes are almost covered. Cover with a lid or heavy aluminum foil.

### Step 3
Roast in the preheated oven until corned beef is so tender it can be flaked apart with a fork, about 5 to 6 hours.
